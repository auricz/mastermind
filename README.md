# mastermind
A C++ program that lets you play the game Mastermind against the computer.

Mastermind is a game where player will guess a code in the form of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple).
The computer will make a code randomly at the start and the player will guess the code.
After each guess, the computer will give feedback on the guess (if a color is correct but in right or wrong spot).
Player wins if he/she guesses the code in 10 guesses or less.
